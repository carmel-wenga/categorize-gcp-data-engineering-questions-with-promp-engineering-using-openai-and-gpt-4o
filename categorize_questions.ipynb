      "1. **Categorize based on services or technologies**:\n",
      "    - Data Access & Security: Cloud IAM, Cloud KMS\n",
      "    - Data Governance: Cloud Dataplex, Data Catalog, Cloud DLP\n",
      "    - Data Ingestion: Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka, Cloud Datastream\n",
      "    - Data Integration:  Cloud Datastream, Data Fusion\n",
      "    - Data Lake: Cloud Storage, Apache Hadoop\n",
      "    - Data Lakehouse: BigLake, BigQuery Omni, \n",
      "    - Data Orchestration: Cloud Composer, Cloud Scheduler, Apache Airflow\n",
      "    - Data Processing: Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataprep, Cloud Dataform, Data Fusion, Cloud Batch\n",
      "    - Data Sharing & Transfer: Analytics Hub, Storage Transfer Service, Transfer Appliance, BigQuery Data Transfer\n",
      "    - Data Visualization: Looker Studio (Previously Data Studio)\n",
      "    - Business Intelligence: Looker\n",
      "    - Data Warehousing: BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift\n",
      "    - Database Design: Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Memorystore\n",
      "    - Machine Learning: Vertex AI, Apache Spark MLlib, Vertex AI AutoML, BigQuery ML, Vision AI, Video Intelligence AI, Natural Language AI, Translation AI, Speech‐to‐Text\n",
      "    - Monitoring: Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Profiler, Cloud Audit Logs\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Categorize Based on Explicit Technology Mentions:**\n",
      "    - If a question explicitly mentions a technology, ensure that the category associated with that technology is included.\n",
      "      - Example: \n",
      "        * Question: \"You need to optimize the performance of queries in BigQuery.\"\n",
      "        * Category: \"Data Warehousing\" because BigQuery is explicitly mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Categorize Based on Answer References:**\n",
      "    - If the answer references a technology, include its associated category even if the question does not explicitly mention it.\n",
      "      - Example: \n",
      "        * Question: \"The first stage of your data pipeline processes terabytes of financial data and creates a sparse, time-series dataset as a key-value pair\"\n",
      "        * Answer: Bigtable \n",
      "        * Category: \"Database Design\" because Bigtable is a key-value database suitable for this use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multiple Categories for Complex Questions:**\n",
      "    - If a question involves more than one technology or service, list all relevant categories.\n",
      "      - Example: \"Transform data with Dataflow and load it to BigQuery.\"\n",
      "      - Categories: \"Data Processing\" and \"Data Warehousing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Handle Technology Interactions:**\n",
      "    - When questions involve interactions between multiple technologies, focus on how these services work together to achieve the goal.\n",
      "      - Example: \"Use Dataflow to transform data and load it into BigQuery for analysis.\"\n",
      "      - Categories: Include both \"Data Processing\" (Dataflow) and \"Data Warehousing\" (BigQuery).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Guidelines for Generating Related Technologies:\n",
      "1. If applicable, also include open-source technologies.\n",
      "    - Example: Cloud Dataflow implements Apache Beam; Cloud Composer implements Apache Airflow; Cloud Pub/Sub and Apache Kafka are both Message Queuing Systems; etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Guidelines for Generating Related Skills:\n",
      "1. **Associate Each skill with a Service or other Technology (open source or not):** Ensure each skill is directly linked to a GCP service or other technology listed in the `gcp_services_or_other_technologies` field. \n",
      "Highlight the specific capability or task related to that service.\n",
      "   - Example: \"BigQuery: Use federated query to analyze data stored in Cloud SQL without moving data.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Focus on Skills and Tasks:** Emphasize the specific skills, techniques, or best practices needed to effectively use the service or technology.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Dataflow: Use side input to add static reference data when processing dynamic datasets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid Definitions of the Tool or the service:** Do not simply define what the service or technology does.\n",
      "    - Example to avoid: \"Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Keep Explanations Concise:** Limit each skill explanation to a maximum of 20 words.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Interaction between technologies**: If the question explicitly or implicitly mentioned the interaction between technologies, emphasize how they work together in solving the problem.\n",
      "    - Example: Use Cloud Function to schedule a Cloud Composer pipeline when a file is uploaded in a Cloud Storage Bucket\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Handling Edge Cases:** If no specific service, technology, or category can be clearly identified, return an empty list for that field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "A: Incorrect. Replication on Cloud SQL is effective to offload reads. However, it does not support a full read-write database.\n",
      "B: Correct. Configuring high availability on Cloud SQL will automatically switch to the secondary instance when the primary instance goes down, thus reducing downtime for the database's users.\n",
      "C: Incorrect. Backups are useful to retrieve older data in case of catastrophic failures such as accidental data deletion. However, they don’t provide continuous availability of the database, because restoring the database takes time.\n",
      "D: Incorrect. Increasing the number of backups does not impact or improve availability. Although there are more backups, restoring the database in case of failure incurs downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud SQL high availability configuration has a primary and secondary instance. Data updates are visible from both instances. In the event of a database failure, the database engineer does not have to manually restore the database instance. Google Cloud will automatically switch the secondary instance to primary, thus maintaining database availability.\n"
